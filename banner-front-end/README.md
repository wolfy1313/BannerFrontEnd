### ***Getting Started***
#### Users will arrive at the home page and be able to view all courses as well as add a course.

### ***App Overview***
#### This app is used to see all student grades for courses in which they are enrolled. One can also add a student and a course. When a course is clicked on, it will show the students enrolled in that course. When a student is clicked on it will show all courses they are enrolled in and the grades they have received. This will also display their overall GPA.
